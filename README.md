# File-Segregation-and-Unsegregation-Automation
Developed a PowerShell script to automate the segregation and unsegregation of files within a folder based on their extensions. This project aimed to enhance file management efficiency by organizing files into subfolders according to their file types and providing a quick solution to revert the process.
